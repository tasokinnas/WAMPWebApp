	<h3>About Psephos</h3>
	<p>
	Psephos Anthropoi was imagined based on a more niche type of election/voter analysis. In states like Idaho (currently the focus for the page), there is primarily one dominate political party that gets elected.  As such, the interest shifts from the general election to the primary election and being able to determine which primary candidate would win in a respective race.  The goal of this site is taking various datas sources and merging them to get better understanding of who would and could win such race.
